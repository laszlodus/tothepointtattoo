    <h3>Laser tattoo removal, procedure, benefits, and risks.</h3>
    <h3>Laser tattoo removal</h3>
    <p>Laser tattoo removal technology has developed rapidly over the past decade. To The Point
        Tattoos Salon is one of the salons in Rugby with laser tattoo removal equipment. Tattoo
        removal has been a To the Point Tattoos Salon service for over six years. This made it
        possible to accumulate experience in skin care after skincare and develop new techniques,
        especially for removing coloured tattoos, darker skin types, heavy coverage, semi-
        permanent make-up, recalcitrant tattoos, and ghosting. To The Point Tattoos salon has the
        latest and highest quality laser machine, enabling the most up-to-date service for laser tattoo
        removal in the UK. At To The Point Tattoos, the quality of the laser machine is essential to
        us; we only purchase the best FDA-approved equipment from trusted, reliable
        manufacturers.
    </p>
    <h3>Procedure</h3>
    <p>The laser shatters and disperses the ink into tiny fragments, allowing the body&#39;s immune
        system, mainly white blood cells (monocytes), to safely remove the broken ink fragments
        from the body. The laser begins at the skin&#39;s surface, removing a layer of ink; each session
        gets deeper and visibly lightens in appearance. It is essential to leave enough time between
        sessions for the ink to be removed; otherwise, the same ink may be hit twice – potentially
        wasting a session. The build-up of heat will cause raised and red skin; specific lasers can
        blister, and others can cause pinpoint bleeding on more potent treatments. The aftercare is
        essential to follow for good skin health. The tattoo will lighten gradually until it is gone or too
        deep to remove. Avoiding the sun on the tattoo between sessions is helpful to minimise
        pigmentation changes in the area. This is usually easily achieved by applying a plaster to the
        area or appropriate clothing.
    </p>
    <h3>Benefits</h3>
    <p>Cleaner, ink-free skin without skin damage! Laser tattoo removal once took 2-3 years, but
        thanks to advanced technology, most clients with regular tattoos will only one-two years
        need treatment needs (depending on the quality of the tattoo ink in the skin). The removal
        process has changed rapidly, making it accessible to all skin types with faster removal times;
        it has become more affordable and, importantly, leaves the skin in better condition. Many
        clients have no visible signs of ever having a tattoo!

    <h3>Risk</h3>
    <p>As with any laser tattoo removal machine, there are risks involved. Picking the correct laser
        for your skin type and ink colour is important to maintain good skin health. Here at To The
        Point Tattoos Salon, the health of your skin is important to us. We want the skin to look as
        fantastic as possible once you have finished. This protects the lasered skin from friction but
        also allows the heat out of the skin to reduce blistering. We also give every client detailed
        aftercare guidance to help you on your journey to healing.
        Blisters are a normal part of the procedure. Here at To The Point Tattoos Salon, we have
        highly trained practitioners who will use techniques to reduce the chances of blistering,
        whether through cooling the tattoo or splitting your treatments up.
        Changes in the skin tone can change, this is more likely if you have sun on the area between
        treatments, pop blisters. Pick scabs or have friction on the tattoo during the healing process.
        Scarring is almost unheard-of lasers and is more down to the person’s skin type and
        aftercare. Occasionally, clients may have endured scarring from the tattooing process itself
        through the needle. The skin is usually raised in this case, and the laser will struggle to
        remove the ink, although removal is possible. Further skin resurfacing can help to flatten the
        skin once the ink is removed.

    <h3>Intense Pulsed Light (IPL)</h3>
    <p>Intense Pulsed Light, or IPL, is another service To The Point Tattoos offers. Intense Pulsed
        Light hair removal (IPL) is a cosmetic procedure that eliminates or reduces undesirable hair
        using light. The apparatus emanates light energy absorbed by hair follicles&#39; melanin
        (pigment). This results in follicle injury, which impedes hair growth. It is productive for
        individuals who have dark hair and fair complexion. Typically, multiple sessions are required
        to achieve enduring results.
